# Mini-project---II
Ordering of permutation :

Given a word or number, the program outputs nth permutation (user's choice) of whichever order of permutation (user's choice)
- Lexicographical order -> generalization of the alphabetical order of the dictionaries to sequences of ordered symbols.
- Reverse lexicographical order -> derived from the lexicographic order by inverting the external order of elements.
- Fike's order -> an elegant type of ordering given by an algorithm designed by Fike in 1975.

The program is written in C++.
